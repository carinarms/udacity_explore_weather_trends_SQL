### Summary

In this project, local and global temperature data was analyzed to compare the temperature trends where I live (Berlin) to overall global temperature trends.

The goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in Berlin, the closest big city to where the student lives. 

### Submission
The final submission is a PDF that includes:

1. An outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart, such as:
- What tools did you use for each step? (Python, SQL, Excel, etc)
- How did you calculate the moving average?
- What were your key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?;

2. Line chart with local and global temperature trends;

3. At least four observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends.
